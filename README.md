# mp3-to-ogg-py
A conversion tool for export mp3 files as ogg, and vice versa

## Usage
```bash
python3 mp3-to-ogg.py
```
Then this will show up:
```

Audio converter
===============
[1] Mp3 to Ogg
[2] Ogg to Mp3
[3] Exit
===============
Select an option -> 
```

1 - Convert mp3 files to ogg, specifying the full path where the mp3 files are (it will convert all of them)

Example:

```
Select an option -> 1
Write the path where the mp3 files are for export them as ogg
MP3 Path ->  /home/klairm/Music/
```
This will check for any .mp3 files on /home/klairm/Music/ and convert them to .ogg on /home/klairm/Music/export/

2 - Same as option 1 but for ogg files, convert ogg files to mp3

3 - Exits the program
